### Interesting Projects

ðŸ§® **[Omega CPU](https://github.com/shetaye/omega-cpu)** *2015 - 2018*

The Omega CPU was my first major project.  It is a 32-bit RISC processor with a custom instruction set and assembly language written in VHDL and deployed on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.  I developed it with the assistance of mentors at the [Bakken museum](https://thebakken.org).

ðŸ“º **[Swish](https://github.com/shetaye/swish)** *2019-2020*

Swish is a video streaming service designed to be an alternative to YouTube's ad-based business model.  Instead of being a free service dependent on ads, Swish collects a small (~$3) a month fee from each user then distributes it to creators based on how much a user watches them.  This means a most of a user's fee goes to the creator they watch the most.  Originally developed for Firebase, it currently runs on a SQL-Express-Vue-Node.JS stack.

ðŸ•Š **[Athena](https://github.com/shetaye/athena)** *2018 - 2021*

Athena is a proof-of-concept Discord bot that moderates servers through [direct democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy).  It was developed on and off from 2018 to 2021, and is the third iteration in the project (the other two being [DDD](https://github.com/shetaye/ddd-webserver) and Direkt).  Athena (then called DDD) was at first a chat-only service which moved to a web platform (like [mee6](https://mee6.xyz)).  It is written using Vue, Node.JS, SQL and Discord.JS.

### Other things I've worked on

ðŸ¦¾ **[FRC Robot](https://github.com/Team2470/FRC-2022-robot)** *2020 - 2022*

I particpated in my Highschool's [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/) robotics team, [Team BJORG](https://www.team2470.org/).  I contributed to the 2020 robot as a software developer and the 2022 robot as control systems lead.  All of our code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/Team2470).  The robot is programmed in Java and was an exercise in repository management considering the number of active developers we had.
